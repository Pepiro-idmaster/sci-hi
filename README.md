# Sci Hi!  Science Museum App/Club 

a)
We present a plan to create a group of services and products to enhance and reinforce the experience of the visitors of the new Science Museum.
Based on surveys and interviews data collection, we are aiming our efforts to a target group of people between 25 to 45 years old. Younger groups are regular visitors to the science museum due to their scholar activities. Therefore, our goal is to create and strength bonds with a mature group, especially female groups.
We believe that personalized welcomings and guidance through the museum as if walking users by the hand could increase the experience of the visitors and diminish the perceived barrier of boredom and intimidation.
A constant follow up and exchange with the users after their visit to the museum using as communication channels the Museum App or Social Media.
We plan an integral system in three stages, previous to the visit, during the visit and after the visit.
The starting point will be previous to the visit to the Science Museum with a marketing campaign promoting a Museum App who embeds the same qualities and characteristics of a club membership card. The App holders will have special benefits like free entrances and ticket discounts and no-queue policy to mention some.
Secondly, while in the museum, the app will behave differently and expand its properties to become a Personal Guide through the museum exhibitions. The main characteristic of the app-guide will be the way the GUI and information are presented, they will be tailor-made to each user based on information previously given by users and the use of radio beacons to know where the user is located during their visit.
For non-app holders, the personalized guide and interactive visit will happen through several wall-size interactive multi-user screens. Users will receive a tag with a RFID to know where they are located in real time.
Lastly, after their visit, app holders will receive interesting info based on their favorite exhibition, tips, quizzes, news, upcoming exhibitions, interesting science facts and earning points programs.

Contributors:
-Lampis: Will be focusing on the interactive screens for the part of the project inside the museum.
-Pepiro: Will be focusing on the mobile app for the part of the project outside the museum previous the visit and after the visit and inside the museum.

c)
Frameworks to be used in this prototype will be mostly App inventor and perhaps some Origami or Adobe XD for presentational purposes.

d)
Target platform:
The idea for the project aims to be develop on a mobile app and on a interactive touch screen in the museum (desktop computer), for prototyping purposes we will only use the mobile part and we will adapt the interactive screens also to a mobile.

e)
Instaling:

f)
Prototype screens

Touch screen app:
This is the idea of how the content will be showed to posible users of the system inside the museum
